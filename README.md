# Cleveland Heart Disease

The goal of this project is to explore the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset and use machine learning to predict whether a patient has heart disease. 

## Data
This database from UCI Cleveland originally contained 76 attributes, with the final dataset containing only 15 attributes.
Experiments with the Cleveland database have concentrated on simply attempting to distinguish the presence of heart disease.

## Analysis
The analysis will be broken up into two sections. The first section will use exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset, discover any structures within, extract variables that are important, detect any outliers or anomalies, and determine attributes should be used for the classification model.

#### Classification

The second section will utilize a Decision Tree, which is a classification algorithm of supervised learning. The Decision Tree will use a two-step process which involves learning and predicting whether a patient has heart disease or not.
